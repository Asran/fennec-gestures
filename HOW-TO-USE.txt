TODO: verify these instructions

To test this extension without needing to install it from AMO:

1. create a folder where the code will reside:
  mkdir fennec-gesture

2. clone the git project
  git clone git://github.com/felipc/fennec-gesture.git

3. Find your Fennec profile folder and extensions folder
  Usually at ~/Library/Application Support/Fennec/Profiles/something.default/

4. Create a file inside the extensions/ folder with a single line of text, which
  is the full path for the extension code (where you cloned the repository)
