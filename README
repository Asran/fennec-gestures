This project is a prototype of a Gesture Engine for Fennec. The tracking bug is
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=476425

This project will be used to track progress both in the implementation of the
core gesture engine plus of user-experience prototypes and experiments related
to the Gestures support and the definition of an API for these gestures.

The core at chrome/content/GestureModule.js will continue to be converted as a
patch to be posted to the bug, but the good thing about this extension is that
it makes packaging everything (the core, the user-experience and the demonstra-
tions) more easily. Soon this will be posted to AMO so that Fennec alpha testers
can test and give opinions on the project.
